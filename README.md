Project Title
Multiple Disease Prediction

Objective
To build a scalable and accurate system that:
Assists in early detection of diseases.
Improves decision-making for healthcare providers.
Reduces diagnostic time and cost by providing quick predictions.

System Architecture
Frontend: User interface for inputting data (e.g., symptoms, test results).
Technologies: Streamlit
Backend: Processes user inputs and interacts with the prediction model.
Framework: Python
Machine Learning Models: Predict diseases based on input data.
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Features
Multi-disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases (e.g., Kidney disease, liver disease,Parkinsons).
User-friendly Interface: Simplified input forms and clear prediction results.
Interactive Visualizations: Graphs and charts to explain predictions.
Secure Data Handling: Ensures user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
Scalable System: Supports a large number of users and diseases.

Workflow
Input Data:
User enters symptoms, demographic details, and test results.
Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
Model Inference:
Predictive models process the input data and provide probabilities for each disease.
Output:
Displays predicted diseases with their respective probabilities and risk levels

Implementation
